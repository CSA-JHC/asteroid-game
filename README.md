# asteroid-game

This game was created as a project.
By creating each piece of the game step by step, it was fairly easy to put the game together. I started off with the ships mobility. Then getting the arrow to shoot at the right location. Once the basics of the game were complete, the asteroids were next, followed by the lives and keeping track of the score.

Asteroid Game is similar to the arcade game Galaga. As asteroids come towards you, you either dodge or shoot.
By dodging, you lose 100 points, and by shooting you gain 100 points. Blue asteroids are bonuses, and by shooting
them down you get a new life. Everytime you lose a life, a blue asteroid will appear. As the game continues, the asteroids get faster and more appear on the screen.

Use the up and down arrows to move and the right arrow to shoot.
